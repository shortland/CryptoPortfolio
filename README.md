Trading with multiple coins means having multiple wallets, possibly accross several websites and platforms. 

This is a simple and compact way to keep track of your coin locations and wallet values.

Currently, there's a single wallet in the demo that anyone can view/edit... I'll be implementing a way for people to have their own wallets (soon).
